# The-Contamited-Zone-Game
This is the game I made during my Highschool Internship at Tepia Co. in 2017.

The File Scripts conatins most of the actual scripts used in the coding of this project.
The File TheContaimatedZoneGame contains a working executable file of the game since I wasn't able to upload the full codebase and assets of the project since they are too big.

The game itself runs on Windows and uses the HTC Vive controllers and headset. This was made and tested using steam vr so no clue if it will work on other programs.
