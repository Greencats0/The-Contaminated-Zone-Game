# The-Contamited-Zone-Game
This is the game my friend and I made during my Highschool Internship at Tepia Co. in 2017.

The File TheContaminatedZone conatins the actual game design contents and programming code of this project.
The File TheContaimatedZoneGame contains a working executable file of the game since the coding files and methods used in there are most likely depricated or discountinued use at this point.

The game itself runs on Windows 10 and uses the HTC Vive controllers and headset. This was made and tested using steam vr so no clue if it will work on other programs.
It will work with the steam knuckles controller with some slight differences in controls than what is stated.
